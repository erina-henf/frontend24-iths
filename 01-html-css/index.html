        <h3>Parakeets</h3>
        <p>
          Parakeets are perhaps the most popular type of pet bird the world
          over. They are exceptionally affectionate and friendly companion birds
          when properly trained and cared for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parakeets are among the most low-maintenance types of birds kept as
          pets, being among the smallest companion birds as well as relatively
          easy to train in their youth. Males especially are known to be great
          birds for first-time owners, as they bond easily to their owners and
          are simple to train.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noted for their beautiful and varied feathers, parakeets are very
          active and playful birds eager to please; parakeets are talking birds
          who can be taught to mimic spoken phrases as a delightful party trick.
